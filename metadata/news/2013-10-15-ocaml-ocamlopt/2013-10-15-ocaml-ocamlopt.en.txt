The ocamlopt option for dev-lang/ocaml, which controlled whether the native-code
compiler was built and installed, in now hard-enabled.

All packages that dealt with this option must be fixed.
(I provided patches to those I was aware of.)

dev-lang/ocaml will need to be reinstalled after those packages,
once the dependency on [ocamlopt] is removed.
