SUMMARY="A semantics description language"
DESCRIPTION="
Ott is a tool for writing definitions of programming languages and calculi.
It takes as input a definition of a language syntax and semantics, in a concise
and readable ASCII notation that is close to what one would write in informal
mathematics. It generates LaTeX to build a typeset version of the definition,
and Coq, HOL, and Isabelle versions of the definition.
