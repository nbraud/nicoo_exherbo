# What ?
This is a repository where I'll put Exherbo packages I write, and hopefully maintain them.

# Why ?
Because they are useful, at least for me.
Because someone else might find them useful.

# Who ?
Nicolas Braud-Santoni (*nicoo* on freenode/#exherbo).
Aspiring computer scientist, French; yes, I have *many* defects :-)
