# What ?
This is a repository where I'll put Exherbo packages I write, and hopefully maintain them.

# Why ?
Because they are useful, at least for me.
Because someone else might find them useful.

# Who ?
Nicolas Braud-Santoni (*nicoo* on freenode/#exherbo).
Aspiring computer scientist, French; yes, I have *many* defects :-)

# On silly licencing issues
## ISC license
The ISC license is a simple, copyfree licence, compatible with 2-clause BSD.
I like it because it is very simple and gives about all liberties you might want (even the ability to redistribute under a non-free license).

Unless the header specifies otherwise, I hold the copyright on each file.
All files for which I am the sole copyright holder are distributed under the terms of the ISC licence (cf LICENCE).

## GPL v2
However, inclusion in Exherbo's tree requires GPLv2.

As such, all files here are also licensed under GPLv2, and the header only mentions it.
