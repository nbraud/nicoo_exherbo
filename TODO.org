* dev-lang/coq
coq.exlib: move export_exlib_phases to top, call emagicdocs
           style: I'd write src_configure like this https://raw.github.com/gist/5076054/  then it is clearer what is going on

* dev-lang/ott
wrong indentation in DEPENDENCIES
src_compile can use DEFAULT_SRC_COMPILE_PARAMS
src_install should use dobin
move WORK to the other variables

* dev-lang/ocaml
ocaml-4.00.1-r1: FILES needs to be quoted, still has the ISC License header
ocaml.exlib: call emagicdocs, move export_exlib_phases to top

14:31 < ~sepek_> nicoo: wnere is the difference to ocaml in ::compnerd

* Misc
sloccount: perl is slotted and needs :* (most likely)
polysh.exlib: wrong indentation in DEPENDENCIES
xcalib: wrong indentation in DEPENDENCIES

* Fonts
SourceCodePro: drop the description from HOMEPAGE
SourceCodePro: if you set HOMEPAGE and DOWNLOADS manually, simply also set REMOTE_IDS and drop sourceforge.exlib
               or pass DIRNAME to sourceforge.exlib as exparam pnv
SourceCodePro: emagicdocs
SourceSansPro: Same as SourceCodePro
AnonymousPro: drop description from homepage
AnonymousPro: Why set FILE if you only use it once? put that in DOWNLOADS, that way it is clearer
mostly cosmetic, as you can see
